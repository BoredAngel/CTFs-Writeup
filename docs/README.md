Hello! I am an undergraduate student and a rookie CTF player aspiring to be a cybersecurity specialist. I Hope this collection of writeups can be beneficial to many people. I'm going rather in depth (more like yapping really) in the writeups, so forgive me if some writeups are too long.

I also do a little bit of pixel art. The following is something I created in Aseprite. I think it's neat.
